## Overview 

Application Insights 

Application Insights is a set of services that provide actionable insight into applications at all stages of the application lifecycle. This data is then integrated into the monitoring and alerting and development tools and process. 

The usage of Application Insights consists of the following key scenarios: 

- Monitor  through dashboard and live metric streams 
- Detect, Diagnose correlate failures with exceptions, stackdumps, tracelogs. 
- Build, Measure, Lean: measure the effectiveness of newly deployed features 

As result, Application Insight telemetry can support both operational and business processes and stakeholders. 


## Guidance 

- Leverage Application across the application lifecycle (development, testing, and production.) To avoid confusion, send the telemetry from different development stages to separate Application Insights resources, with separate instrumentation keys. 

### Monitoring Guidance 

- Leverage 2 watcher nodes: the first from within Azure using Network Performance Manager (NPM), the other from outside, such as those provide through Application Insights Availability Tests. 
- The following compare the use of Application Insights LiveStream and Azure Monitor Metrics: 

| | __Live Stream__ |__Metrics Explorer and Analytics__ | 
|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Latency  | Data displayed within one second |  Aggregated over minutes |
| No Retention  | Data persists while it's on the chart, and is then discarded  |  [Data Retained for 90 Days](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-data-retention-privacy#how-long-is-the-data-kept) |
| On Demand  | Data is streamed while you open Live Metrics  | Data is sent whenever the SDK is installed and enabled |
| Cost | There is no charge for Live Stream data  |  Subject to [pricing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-pricing) |
| Sampling  | All selected metrics and counters are transmitted. Failures and stack traces are sampled. TelemetryProcessors are not applied.  |  Events may be [sampled](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-api-filtering-sampling) |
| Control Channel  | Filter control signals are sent to the SDK. We recommend you [secure this channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-live-stream#secure-channel).  | |

### Detect and Diagnose Guidance 

- Detect application code execution exceptions 
- Set Alerts and meaningful thresholds throughout the application lifecycle for the following key application metrics: 

| __Guidance__ |
|------------------------------|
| Server Response | 
| Failed Requests  | 
| Page Views  | 
| Page Load Network Connect Time  | 
| Send Request Time  | 
| Client Processing Time  | 
| Browser Page Load Time  | 
| Browser Exceptions  | 
| Server Exceptions  | 
| Test Duration | 
| Availability | 
| ASP .NET Request Execution Time |
| ASP .NET Request Rate |
| ASP .NET Requests in Application Queue |
| Available Memory |
| Exception Rate |
| Process CPU |
| Process CPU (all cores) |
| Process IO Rate |
| Process Private Bytes |
| Processor Time |
| Request Rate |

### Build Measure Learn Guidance 

- Consider server-side event logging first over client-side (JavaScript).  
- Integrating the SDK through Visual Studio and redeploying the application is preferred over leveraging the wizard to drop specific DLLs for Application Insights into your website bin folder. 
- Existing applications must manually add the [Application Insights NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Web/) to integrate with Application Insights.  
- Limit us of multiple trace listeners because they execute sequentially. 
- Avoid using the default wadlogstable to store all events to prevent it from becomes so large that data filtering is not possible. Consider e other frameworks like NLog, Log4Net, or Slab in such cases. 
- Establish a consistent strategy in terms of event ids, event data structure. 
- The [Azure naming convention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions) will be used as starting point.  
- Consider <Environment>-<Location>-<Instance>-<Service>-<Role>-<Object> 
- Code changes to applications to enable instrumentations will need to be carefully planned/tested. Related code changes should be aligned to deployment release windows. 
- Data upload fine-tuning required (in terms of quantity & quality) 
- A phased approach required for complex systems to ensure no impact to production systems, can slow down progress 
- Logging normalizationâ€¯requires core code changes.
