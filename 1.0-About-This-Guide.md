# Introduction 

 

Traditional monitoring and alerting involved a siloed approach for each infrastructure components such as storage, networking, and compute. These approaches have evolved towards a comprehensive application and service telemetry that can be leveraged for more than monitoring and enable application optimization, discover user insights, and drive business value. 


This telemetry based approach provides: 

 
- Visibility: foundational set of metrics, alerts, and notifications across core Azure services  
- Insight: analytics and diagnostics across applications, compute, storage, and network resources, including anomaly detection and proactive alerting  
- Optimization: Understand how users are engaging with your applications, identify sticking points, develop cohorts, and optimize business impact

## Sections 

 

Monitoring in Azure requires a composite view of the underlying infrastructure, third party dependencies, and application or services.  This is achieved through the following layered approach:  

 
1. Share Capabilities (Azure Alerts, Dashboards, and Metrics Explorer) 
    - Azure service telemetry for monitoring and near real-time alerting. 
2. Azure Core Monitoring (Azure Monitor, Azure Advisor, Azure Health) 
    - Consolidated and indexed telemetry repository for monitoring, reporting, and alerting 
3. Azure Infrastructure Monitoring ( OMS, Service Map, Log Analytics, and Container Monitoring, ) 
4. Azure Application Monitoring (Application Insights) 
    - Application level telemetry 
5. PowerBI: Consolidated reporting for trending and reporting distribution to non-technical audiences
