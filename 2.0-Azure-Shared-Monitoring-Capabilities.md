# 2.0 Azure Shared Monitoring Capabilities 

## Overview 

Dashboards, Metrics, and Alerts 

The shared capabilities of the Azure monitoring stack can be leveraged to integrate into a consistent view. These include the following components:  

Dashboards combine different kinds of data into a single pane in the Azure portal which can then be share with other Azure users. Dashboard can draw on information from different sources including Metrics Charts, Activity Logs, Log Analytics, and Application Insights. 

Metrics are numerical values generated by an Azure resource to help you understand the operation and performance of the resource in near-real time.  

Alerts provide proactive notification of critical conditions and potentially take corrective action. Alert rules can use data from multiple sources, including metrics and logs.

## Guidance 

 

- Build dashboard to collaborate and work across support, development, testing, security, and infrastructure team and traditional tooling boundaries. 
- Restrict access to dashboards and underlying data to authorized personnel. 
- Create metric alert rule that sends a notification or takes automated action when the metric reaches the threshold that you have set.
