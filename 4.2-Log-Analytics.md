## Overview 

Log Analytics is the Insights and Analytics component of the Operations Management Suite (OMS). Log Analytics is  used to correlate information across data sources and provides opportunities for alerting on situations that merit attention. 

### Collecting the Data 

There are different ways of collecting logs and metrics for Azure services: 

- **(Recommended)**  The Azure Marketplace contains the [list of management solutions](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/category/management-tools?page=1&subcategories=management-solutions) for Log Analytics. In addition to collecting data, solutions typically include log searches and views to help you analyze the operation of a particular application or service. 

- Azure diagnostics direct to Log Analytics (see [Diagnostics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-storage) in the reference table) 

- Azure diagnostics to Azure storage to Log Analytics (see [Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-storage) in the reference table) 

- Connectors for Azure services (See [Connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-storage) in the reference table) 

- OMS Extensions for Azure VMS (See [Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-storage) in the reference table) 

- Scripts to collect and then post data into Log Analytics (See the [reference table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-azure-storage) and for services that are not listed) 
    - [Runbook Log Analytics](4.5-Runbook-to-Log-Analytics.md) 

### Querying the Data 

- The Log Analytics is the log search feature is used to combine and correlate any machine data from multiple sources. 

- Each data source and solution stores its data in dedicated tables in the Log Analytics workspace. Documentation for each data source and solution includes the name of the data type that it creates and a description of each of its properties. Many queries will only require data from a single tables, but others may use a variety of options to include data from multiple tables. 

 
### Analyzing the Data 

- By default, results are displayed in a table. Chart can also be used to display results in a more graphic view. For timeseries charts, sudden spike or step in data, you may see a highlighted point on the line. This indicates that Smart Diagnostics has identified a combination of properties that filter out the sudden change. 

- Power BI with Log Analytics allows log queries that export their results to corresponding datasets in Power BI. The query-and-export continues to automatically run on a schedule. 

 

### Creating Alerts 

- You create Alerts via alert rules that automatically run log searches at regular intervals. If the results of the log search match a particular criterion, an alert record is created. 

- From a log search result in Azure Log Analytics, you can also select Take Action to perform one or more of the following actions: 
    - Email. Send an email with the details of the alert to one or more recipients 
    - Webhook. Invoke an external process through a single HTTP POST request 
    - Runbook. Start a runbook in Azure Automation 
    
## Guidance 
 

- Select nearest Azure Region to your Datacenter where Log Analytics and other OMS services are available to reduce latency in data send/receive 

- Configure the Log Analytics dashboards to create visualizations of saved log searches. 

- IaaS 

    - Always use OMS Extension (ARM or PowerShell to deploy) so VM is recognized as an Azure VMs. Do not use DSC to deploy the agent, only to ensure it’s running 

    - Enable Diagnostics on virtual machines, particularly if a monitoring agent isn’t being installed.  Boot diagnostics are particularly useful for troubleshooting VM boot issues. 

- Route all diagnostics to Log Analytics (or Application Insights) to provide analytics, search, and custom alerting on metrics data from resources to gain a holistic view of application health. 

 
- Begin with the relevant Marketplace solutions and enhance them with individual dashboards and alerts as required. Enable only required solution packs in a phased approach.  

 
- Current [SLA for Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/log-analytics/v1_1/) states that at least 99.9% of the time, log data will be indexed within 6 hours of the data being queued for indexing by the Operations Management Suite Log Analytics Service.  

 
- Add the Azure Activity Log from all your subscriptions to Log Analytics to help identify when unexpected or conflicted changes are applied. 

- There are ingestion and storage costs related to the use of Log Analytics. For custom logs, strategies such as pre-parsing logfiles may be required to ensure the most valuable logs are being processed. 

- Use the [Log Analytics Usage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-usage#understand-the-usage-dashboard) dashboard to review and analyze data usage. Extrapolate usage metrics for production sizing for expanded periods such as month/year: [Analyze data usage in Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-usage) 

- Hybrid 
    - OMS Gateway: For large-scale or hybrid or multi-cloud deployments, use OMS gateway to pool and forward logs to LA. For small-scale deployments, use OMS gateway or Direct agent to forward logs to Log Analytics.
