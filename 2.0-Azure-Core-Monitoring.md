Overview 

Azure Monitor, Azure Advisor, Service Health, Activity Log 


Azure Monitor enables core monitoring for Azure services by allowing the collection of near real-time metrics, activity logs, and diagnostic logs. As such, it provides a point-in-time snapshot of the state of Azure resources. 


Azure Advisor analyzes resource configuration and usage telemetry to recommends solutions to improve the cost effectiveness, performance, high availability, and security of Azure resources. 

1. Service Health tracks three types of health events that may impact your resources: 
2. Service issues - Problems in the Azure services that affect you right now.  
3. Planned maintenance - Upcoming maintenance that can affect the availability of your services in the future.  

Health advisories - Changes in Azure services that require your attention. Examples include when Azure features are deprecated or if you exceed a usage quota. 

The Activity Log reports control-plane events for subscriptions and determine the “what, who, and when” for any write operations taken on the resources in the subscription. 

 

##Guidance 

 
- Enable Diagnostics on virtual machines, particularly if a monitoring agent isn’t being installed.  Boot diagnostics are particularly useful for troubleshooting VM boot issues. 
- Leverage Azure Advisor cost, performance, high availability, and security recommendations. 
- Send these metrics and logs to Azure Log Analytics for trending and detailed analysis, or create additional alert rules to proactively notify you of critical issues as a result of that analysis. 
- Add the Azure Activity Log from all  subscriptions to Log Analytics to help identify when unexpected or conflicted changes are applied. 

  

## Procedure 


1. Azure Monitor 

- Following [these steps and pinning all relevant tiles to a dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-get-started) to create comprehensive views of your application and infrastructure. 

2. Service Health 

- [Pin a personalized health map to your dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/service-health-overview#pin-a-personalized-health-map-to-your-dashboard)  
- [Create activity log alerts on service notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-activity-log-alerts-on-service-notifications) 

 
3. Activity Logs in Log Analytics 

- [Collect and analyze Azure activity logs in Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-activity) 

4. Azure Advisor
