|  | _Single Workspace_ |_Multiple Workspaces_ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| PROS | Unifying data collection from nodes, Azure resources, subscriptions, centralizing views & access. Simple to manage, one-time create of Log Analytics resources, Re-use  | Distribute data collection from nodes Segregate views & access   |
| CONS  | No data-isolation  | Need to be managed programmatically for scale: define the configuration in ARM template and redeploy and scale when needed.    | 

The following lists OMS Workspaces patterns to address common enterprise scenarios. These can be used individually, or in combination to address specific requirements. 

| __Workspace Pattern__ | __Description__ |
