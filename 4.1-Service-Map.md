## Overview 

 

Over the years legacy datacenters have hosting a growing number of solutions where they owner is unclear, the original development team has moved on, the external dependencies are not identified. Profiling, monitoring, and migrating  these workloads can difficult in these circumstances. 

 

Through service dependency mapping Service Map can build an inventory of Windows and Linux workloads and establish that dependencies and then you can group applications.  

 

In doing so, Service Map helps eliminate the guesswork of problem isolation by  how systems are connected and affecting each other. In addition to identifying failed connections, it helps identify misconfigured load balancers, surprising or excessive load on critical services, and rogue clients, such as development  machines talking to production systems.  

 

Service dependency mapping can also be used as part of data center relocation efforts traditionally required small armies. Through dependency mapping tools such as Service Map this can be highly automation.  

 

## Guidance 

 

Leverage Service Map as part of an incremental workload migration to conduct dependency analysis to determine the appropriate workload migration approach: lift-and-shift, modernize, or leave it in place.
