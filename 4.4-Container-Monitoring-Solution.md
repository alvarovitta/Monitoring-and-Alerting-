## Overview 

 

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is an Azure offering which reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing a Kubernetes cluster by offloading it to Azure. As a managed service, AKS does not provide detailed built-in monitoring. 

 

As the same time, Customers will need to be concerned about these services as since they can affect container health and workloads.  Customized Kubernetes monitoring for AKS must integrate with the overall Azure Monitoring tools.  

 

## Guidance 

- [Container Monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-containers ) 
- [AKR Performance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring/monitoring-container-health ) 



 

## Procedure 

 
1. Enable Container Monitoring 
  - [Installing and configuring the solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-containers#installing-and-configuring-the-solution) 

2. Enable AKS Monitoring 
  - [Enable container health monitoring for a new cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring/monitoring-container-health#enable-container-health-monitoring-for-a-new-cluster)  
  - Enabling monitoring of your AKS container already deployed cannot be accomplished from the portal, it can only be performed using the provided Azure Resource Manager template Enabling monitoring of and existing AKS using the ARM templates. See [Enable container health monitoring for existing managed clusters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring/monitoring-container-health#enable-container-health-monitoring-for-existing-managed-clusters).
